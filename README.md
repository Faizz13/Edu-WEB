## About this project

In this application, users can easily scan or upload an image of any traditional toy, and within moments, receive detailed information about its history, how itâ€™s used, and its significance in the culture from which it originates. As you explore this collection, you will discover the deep connection between traditional toys and the various ethnic groups that inhabit Indonesia, from the Javanese, Balinese, and Batak, to the Dayak, Toraja, and beyond.
