## Google Cloud Pricing Calculator

The Google Cloud Pricing Calculator is used in our project to estimate and plan cloud costs effectively. It provides detailed cost projections based on selected services, usage scenarios, and configurations. This tool helps ensure that we stay within budget, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions by comparing different setups and pricing options before implementation.

## TravelIn DOCUMENTATION API

We use Postman as a documentation of our API is because of its intuitive and structured platform for describing endpoints, parameters, headers, and API responses. Features like Collections, Environment Variables, and API Documentation make it easier to manage interactive and developer-friendly documentation. Additionally, its direct integration with API testing ensures that the documentation remains accurate and up-to-date with the latest functionality.
